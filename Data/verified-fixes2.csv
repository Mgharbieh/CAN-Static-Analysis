No specific or hardcoded limits of 65536 or 2^16 exist in the code base.

Initial suspicion was that open/close results in a client session being created and destroyed. Client sessions have with them an RX thread per connection client (via open) to deliver the received messages. The QNX OS limit of maximum number of threads per process is known to be 32767, so we investigated whether the threads were not being cleaned up properly. This wasn't the case however, and all the threads created are detached and cleanly shutdown.

To further test this theory an experiment was done. Driver dev-can-linux was started and while monitoring the number of threads active using command ""pidin -p pid"" messages were sent using command ""cansend -u0,tx0 -m0x1234,1,0xABCD"". No increase in the number of threads noted.

Next to replicate the example code given in https://github.com/Deniz-Eren/dev-can-linux/issues/57, i.e. ""void *fctThreadCan3( void *arg )"", we wrote a new unit test SingleSendReceiveAfterManyOpenClose in tests/driver/io/driver-io-tests.cpp to perform the same test as test SingleSendReceive but only after opening and closing the file descriptors 100,000 times.

Exact problem described in https://github.com/Deniz-Eren/dev-can-linux/issues/56 was successfully replicated by test SingleSendReceiveAfterManyOpenClose. After running the test the command ""candump -u0,rx0"" no longer recieves messages from command ""cansend -u0,tx0 -m0x1234,1,0xABCD"".

The error message ""rx_loop exit: Unable to attach to channel."" was noted during the test produced from https://github.com/Deniz-Eren/dev-can-linux/blob/1bb3cfede13e847c98a309da3b5fbc415c4694ce/src/resmgr.c#L656

The problem was identified to be in rx_loop whereby the message_connect() was never being disconnected. After adding the correct disconnection the problem is shown to be fixed.

GitHub,qtserialbus,Andre Hartmann,"SocketCAN: Fix frame write error handling

Part I

If ConfigurationParameter::CanFdKey is not set,
the SocketCAN driver is not forced to CAN FD mode.
Therefore, writing CAN FD frames fails, even if the
bus (virtual or real) is CAN FD capable.

The existing error handling code already checked this,
but only if the CAN FD frame payload was longer than
eight data bytes.

Now the error message also appears when trying to write
CAN FD frames with payload size 0...8.

Part II

In line 348, QCanBusFrame::isValid() is called. This
function returns false if the payload size exceeds
the frame's maximum payload length. The function
SocketCanBackend::writeFrame then early returns
with false.

The maximum size error handling code is therefore
no longer reached and can be removed.

GitHub,qtserialbus,Andre Hartmann,"CAN: Fix overreading QByteArray buffer

The old code did not take the size of the payload
QByteArray into account, so that for small payloads
read accesses outside the QByteArray data field
occurred.

While this should be no big problem in reality,
memory checkers like Address Sanitizer will report
such issues.

We now only copy the bytes the payload QByteArray
really provides. We can do this, as every derived
QCanBusDevice::writeFrame() method already does a
QCanBusFrame::isValid() check before enqueuing the
outgoing frames, so that the maximum length of the
payload field is always guaranteed, for CAN 2.0
as well as CAN FD.
